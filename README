Overview
========

LoginKit is an attempt to implement a logind
(http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd) shim, which allows packages
that depend on it to work, without dependency on a specific init system.

This branch is targeted at the stock configuration of Devuan Jessie and allows
xfce4-power-manager to run without a logind dependency.

Dependencies
============

LoginKit requires GLib.

Building
========

On Debian, install libglib2.0-dev:
   apt-get install -y libglib2.0-dev

To build LoginKit:
  make
